# Homework API

## Run project

- npm install
- npm start
- Go to http://localhost:3000

## API documentation:

- Start project - npm start

For other script look at the package.json

We are building API for apartment building. 12 apartments.
Utilities like water, gas and etc.  
  
Switch between branches:  
* `$ git checkout <baranch_name>`

### Lets add parts of our api.

We hawe apartment owners (users) and they are using services.  
Let's begin from users.

- Add databse `db.ts` with users to the root of project
- Add `components/users/interfaces.ts` for users and import it to database.
- Add `components/users/controller.ts`
  For that we need express, responseCodes, user interfaces and services ts files. In services.ts we defining all request from database.
- Create `general/responseCodes.ts`
- Create `users/services.ts`

### now create index.ts

index.ts must assemble all parts what we did.
So now our `index.ts`looks like this:

```javascript
import express, { Application } from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';
import usersController from './components/users/controller';

import { port } from './components/general/settings';

const app: Application = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors());

app.get('/users', usersController.getAllUsers);
app.get('/users/:id', usersController.getUserById);
app.delete('/users/:id', usersController.removeUser);

app.listen(port, () => {
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
  console.log(`Server is running on port: ${port}`);
});
```

### Add middleware for testing purposes

We add middleware to `components/general/testMiddleware.ts`
At the beginning we add just testing purposes middleware, what says, is the connection https or not and also tels us one defined variable.  
No point, just testing.

We need import our middleware to `index.ts` and then register it â€“ `app.use()`

### Short description about what we did

- in `interfaces.ts` we explaining to api, what kind can be the data in specific database place. So if in interface are `id`and `name`then we cant use something more in database. Now we can import those interfaces to database file, so the database know, what data must be in database.  
  In `service.ts`we have all endpoints.  
  And in `controller.ts`we have functions, what are doing what we need.

### next do the same to all endpoints.

At the moment we have Users, Utilities, gasVolume and random servicees.  
Later we decide, what we need more or maybe we must merge some of endpoints.
For each i created endpoint.

### Passwords hashing
We need install crypting module  
`npm install bcrypt` 
`npm install --save-dev @types/bcrypt`
* new folder for API services:  
`general/services/hashService.ts`  

* Test hashing  
postman or thunder client  
post
localhost:3000/users
Body
json

*** For posting you must have post endpoint ***
